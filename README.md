# B-Real

In this project, we used an ESP32CAM, specifically the ESP32-Wrover-Dev, to take one photo during a timed study session and display the photo on a website. The code is mainly adapted from https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-cam-take-photo-display-web-server/. 

##Hardware Setup

Connect the camera itself to the ESP32 and use a Micro USB to USB cable to connect the ESP32 to a computer. You also may need to set up a hotspot that both the ESP32 and the device that you want to display the website on are connected to. Once the code is flashed to the ESP32, you can use a portable battery or any other device to power the ESP32. This is all that is needed for hardware setup!

##Software Setup
